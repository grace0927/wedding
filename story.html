        <p class="lead"  style="text-align:left"><b>How we met</b></br>
        The two Fengs met each other on Dec 2nd, 2012, which is the last Eucharist of that year. The funny thing is, both of them lost their memory on their first sight, since God havent opened their eyes to each other. When they passed over the old year and met again in New year's day, she noticed him in prayers meeting night and remembered his name and face :) </p>

        <p  style="text-align:left"> <b>How the relationship began</b></br>
        As truly christians understand that they would find the significant other only under His guidance, both the Fengs were waiting for Him during their regular serving in Church and intimacy to God, until May 2013. The words He placed on him was in Num 13:20:"let us go at once and take possession, for we aew well able to overcome it",which touched him in deep heart and made him realized that she was the one He prepared. At the same time, the words she got through daily bible reading was in Joshua 1:9, "be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD, your GOD is with you wherever you go", which made her being confused. About a week before, some elder sisters and brothers in church told her that they all felt they two would be a good match in marriage. However, why the God said "be couraged" to her instead gave her the "yes or no" answer directly as she asked if he was the one He prepared for her?After a while like a month later, she realized His means since they began to know each other more and more spiritually. In this way, the two Fengs both confirmed in front of HIM, that they ARE the pair be preprared by HIM.Thereafter,a new journey started!</p>

        <p  style="text-align:left"> <b>Engagement</b></br>
        Though the both Fengs knew that this relationship was only resulting to marriage which would definitely dedicated to HIM, it was not an "ideal" case as a general means of a good match as pepole all regarded as. It was unbelieveable that God put two people together who differ in thousands of ways.They both suffered a lot to being refined as a real good match to each other,and probably it would be a life-time lesson to learn, however, they also became more and more clear that HIS promise would never be changed by anyone, anything or any special enviornment. Thus one Friday evening, when they were on the way to dump the waste to the trash as finishing the the last service of a regular fellowship in SCC, she noticed that he also carried a small box which was unopened, "it is the ring" he didn't even give a suprise, but knelt down and asked "will you marry me, Qing?"..... And then they were making one more step in HIS will!</p>
